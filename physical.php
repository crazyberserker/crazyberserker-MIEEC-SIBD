            <h1>Physical Assessment</h1>
                <h2> A physical examination is a routine test your primary care provider (PCP) performs to check your overall health. A PCP may be a doctor, a nurse practitioner, or a physician assistant. The exam is also known as a wellness check. You donâ€™t have to be sick to request an exam.

The physical exam can be a good time to ask your PCP questions about your health or discuss any changes or problems that you have noticed.

There are different tests that can be performed during your physical examination. Depending on your age or medical or family history, your PCP may recommend additional testing.!</h2>
